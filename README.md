# HeartAttackPredictAI
Final Project for my High School Introduction to Data Science course

PROCESS
Finding data on medical reading related to heart attacks, I utilized https://aiclub.world to create a neural network based on decision tree algorithms. After fine tuning my algorithm, I was able to increase the accuracy to about 90%.

WHY
Heart attacks are one of the leading illnesses that kill people every year. I aimed to make this project to potentially help medical professionals better determine whether someone was likely to suffer a heart attack.
